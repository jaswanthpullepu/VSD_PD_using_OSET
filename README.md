#  VSD_PD_Using_OSET

The purpose of this repository is to provide a complete idea about the workshop on VLSI SoC/Physical design using open-source EDA Tools.The main target audience of the
workshop is 
1. one who wants to learn SoC planning 
2. one who wants to learn chip design from specifications to Layout
3. one who is curious to know, what happens before Synthesis, Physical design and STA.

The open source tools that are involved in this workshop are as follows
1. **Yosys** – for Synthesis
2. **Graywolf** – for Placement
3. **Qrouter** – for Routing
4. **Netgen** – for LVS
5. **Magic** – for Layout and Floorplanning
6. **Qflow** – RTL2GDS integration
7. **OpenSTA & Opentimer** -Pre-layout and Post-layout Static timing analysis
  
>The overall workshop is based on the RISC V processor to know about more [About RISC](https://riscv.org/about/) and its specifications [SPEC](https://riscv.org/technical/specifications/).

The refrence design used here is **RISC-V based Raven SoC (First silicon proven open source SoC)**

####  The total workshop is around 5 days.
The responsibilities of each individual day is listed below
